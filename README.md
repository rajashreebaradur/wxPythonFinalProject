# wxPythonFinalProject

##Repository for wxPythonFinalProject for Python course

1. Python version : Python 2.7 for 64-bit OS

2. The application runs on Windows without any errors.
   Windows 7 64-bit operating system

   The application could not be run on Mac OSX El Capitan since there were some issues while installing the wxPython package.

3. External package used is wxPython 3.0
   Download at http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
   Select the wxPython3.0-win64-py27	64-bit Python 2.7
   Install wxpython in the same directory as Python 2.7

   I had encountered an issue since I had 32-bit of Python 2.7 and 64-bit of wxPython installed.
   Hence make sure to download the same versions according to your OS (32 bit or 64 bit).
   
4. The application needs to be run on Idle, that comes with Python 2.7.
   Launch Idle and open the image_viewer.py file from the project folder.
   Hit F5 or Run Module from the UI.
